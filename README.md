# BN-ISM-MICMAC
This Python implementation of BN-ISM-MICMAC reads expert pairwise influence evaluations, converts them into Bipolar Neutrosophic Numbers (BNNs), aggregates them with a BN Weighted Average, computes the Crisp Decision Matrix, and performs ISM-based MICMAC analysis with visualizations and Excel outputs.
